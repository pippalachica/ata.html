      <p id="synopsis">The Bayonne ATA Legacy Team is a team made up of 7 awesome leaders. Led by Mr. Cory Hernandez, the Bayonne Legacy Team consists of three 3rd degree black belts,two 2nd degree black belts, and two 1st degree black belts. In fact, they all started out in Bayonne! The team was brought together during the summer of 2020, at the height of the Coronavirus pandemic lockdown. Mr. Hernandez called upon six awesome martial artists and offered them the chance to inspire kids to be awesome at Tae Kwon Do just how they were inspired. They were on board without hesitation, and almost 5 months later, we have the awesome team you see today!<p>
